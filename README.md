# Minesweeper
This project coded in C# consists of reproducing the minesweeper game using the Visual Studio environment.

The player can select a square on the grid by left-clicking, and this square reveals a number indicating the number of mines in the adjacent squares. Using this information, the player must deduce the location of the mines and mark them with flags to avoid them using the right mouse click. A counter shows the number of flags to help the player keep track.

If the player chooses a square containing a mine, he loses the game, and can start again as many times as he wishes.

Here are some images of the game :
